# Wurdz

**DISCLAIMER THIS WAS DONE JUST AS A LEARNING TOOL. THIS IS NOT MY ORIGINAL CODE AND ALL CREDIT IS DUE TO THE ORIGINATOR**
Wurdz is a clone of the popular game Wordle.
This was a fun follow-along video that I did watching [WebDevSimplified] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wak7iN4JZzU&t=2813s). 
Check out his [GitHub] (https://github.com/WebDevSimplified) for the original code and other fun clones and learning tools!
